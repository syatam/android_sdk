## <a id="example-app"></a>Example app

There is an example app inside the [`example` directory][example]. You can open the Android project to see an example on
how the adjust SDK can be integrated.

## <a id="basic-integration"></a>Basic integration

These are the minimal steps required to integrate the adjust SDK into your Android project. We are going to assume that you
use Android Studio for your Android development and target an Android API level 9 (Gingerbread) or later.

If you're using the [Maven Repository][maven] you can start with [this step](#sdk-add).

### <a id="sdk-get"></a>Get the SDK

Download the latest version from our [releases page][releases]. Extract the archive in a folder of your choice.

### <a id="sdk-import"></a>Import the Adjust module

In the Android Studio menu select `File → Import Module...`.

![][import_module]

In the `Source directory` field, locate the folder you extracted in step 1. Select and choose the folder
`./android_sdk/Adjust/adjust`.  Make sure the module name `:adjust` appears before finishing.

![][select_module]

The `adjust` module should be imported into your Android Studio project afterwards.

![][imported_module]

### <a id="sdk-add"></a>Add the SDK to your project

Open the `build.gradle` file of your app and find the `dependencies` block. Add the following line:

```
compile project(":adjust")
```

![][gradle_adjust]

If you are using Maven, add this line instead:

```
compile 'com.adjust.sdk:adjust-android:4.10.0'
```

### <a id="sdk-gps"></a>Add Google Play Services

Since the 1st of August of 2014, apps in the Google Play Store must use the [Google Advertising ID][google_ad_id] to
uniquely identify devices. To allow the adjust SDK to use the Google Advertising ID, you must integrate the
[Google Play Services][google_play_services]. If you haven't done this yet, follow these steps:

1. Open the `build.gradle` file of your app and find the `dependencies` block. Add the following line:

    ```
    compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-analytics:9.2.1'
    ```

    ![][gradle_gps]

2. **Skip this step if you are using version 7 or later of Google Play Services**:
   In the Package Explorer open the `AndroidManifest.xml` of your Android
   project.  Add the following `meta-data` tag inside the `<application>`
   element.

    ```xml
    <meta-data android:name="com.google.android.gms.version"
               android:value="@integer/google_play_services_version" />
    ```

    ![][manifest_gps]

### <a id="sdk-permissions"></a>Add permissions

In the Package Explorer open the `AndroidManifest.xml` of your Android project. Add the `uses-permission` tag for
`INTERNET` if it's not present already.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

If you are **not targeting the Google Play Store**, add both of these permissions instead:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE" />
```

![][manifest_permissions]

### <a id="sdk-proguard"></a>Proguard settings

If you are using Proguard, add these lines to your Proguard file:

```
-keepclassmembers enum * {
    public static **[] values();
    public static ** valueOf(java.lang.String);
}
-keep class com.adjust.sdk.plugin.MacAddressUtil {
    java.lang.String getMacAddress(android.content.Context);
}
-keep class com.adjust.sdk.plugin.AndroidIdUtil {
    java.lang.String getAndroidId(android.content.Context);
}
-keep class com.google.android.gms.common.ConnectionResult {
    int SUCCESS;
}
-keep class com.google.android.gms.ads.identifier.AdvertisingIdClient {
    com.google.android.gms.ads.identifier.AdvertisingIdClient$Info getAdvertisingIdInfo(android.content.Context);
}
-keep class com.google.android.gms.ads.identifier.AdvertisingIdClient$Info {
    java.lang.String getId();
    boolean isLimitAdTrackingEnabled();
}
```

If you are **not targeting the Google Play Store**, you can remove the `com.google.android.gms` rules.

![][proguard]

**Important**: If you are using an `-overloadaggressively` flag in your Proguard file, then in order for the adjust SDK to
work properly you should consider one of two possible scenarios:

* Remove `-overloadaggressively` if it is not necessary
* Add a `-useuniqueclassmembernames` flag to your Proguard file

### <a id="sdk-broadcast-receiver"></a>Adjust broadcast receiver

If you are **not using your own broadcast receiver** to receive `INSTALL_REFERRER` intent, add the following `receiver` tag
inside the `application` tag in your `AndroidManifest.xml`.

```xml
<receiver
    android:name="com.adjust.sdk.AdjustReferrerReceiver"
    android:exported="true" >
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="com.android.vending.INSTALL_REFERRER" />
    </intent-filter>
</receiver>
```

![][receiver]

We use this broadcast receiver to retrieve the install referrer, in order to improve conversion tracking.

If you are already using a different broadcast receiver for the `INSTALL_REFERRER` intent, follow
[these instructions][referrer] to add the Adjust broadcast receiver.

### <a id="sdk-integrate"></a>Integrate the SDK into your app

To start with, we'll set up basic session tracking.

### <a id="basic-setup"></a>Basic setup

We recommend using a global android [Application][android_application] class to initialize the SDK. If you don't have one
in your app already, follow these steps:

1. Create a class that extends `Application`.
    ![][application_class]

2. Open the `AndroidManifest.xml` file of your app and locate the `<application>` element.
3. Add the attribute `android:name` and set it to the name of your new application class pefixed by a dot.

    In our example app we use an `Application` class named `GlobalApplication`, so the manifest file is configured as:
    ```xml
     <application
       android:name=".GlobalApplication"
       ... >
         ...
    </application>
    ```

    ![][manifest_application]

4. In your `Application` class find or create the `onCreate` method and add the following code to initialize the adjust
SDK:

    ```java
    import com.adjust.sdk.Adjust;
    import com.adjust.sdk.AdjustConfig;

    public class GlobalApplication extends Application {
        @Override
        public void onCreate() {
            super.onCreate();

            String appToken = "{YourAppToken}";
            String environment = AdjustConfig.ENVIRONMENT_SANDBOX;
            AdjustConfig config = new AdjustConfig(this, appToken, environment);
            Adjust.onCreate(config);
        }
    }
    ```

    ![][application_config]

    Replace `{YourAppToken}` with your app token. You can find this in your
    [dashboard].

    Depending on whether you build your app for testing or for production, you must
    set `environment` with one of these values:

    ```java
    String environment = AdjustConfig.ENVIRONMENT_SANDBOX;
    String environment = AdjustConfig.ENVIRONMENT_PRODUCTION;
    ```

    **Important:** This value should be set to `AdjustConfig.ENVIRONMENT_SANDBOX`
    if and only if you or someone else is testing your app. Make sure to set the
    environment to `AdjustConfig.ENVIRONMENT_PRODUCTION` just before you publish
    the app. Set it back to `AdjustConfig.ENVIRONMENT_SANDBOX` when you start
    developing and testing it again.

    We use this environment to distinguish between real traffic and test traffic
    from test devices. It is very important that you keep this value meaningful at
    all times! This is especially important if you are tracking revenue.

### <a id="session-tracking"></a>Session tracking

**Note**: This step is **really important** and please **make sure that you implement it properly in your app**. By
implementing it, you will enable proper session tracking by the adjust SDK in your app.

#### <a id="session-tracking-api14"></a>API level 14 and higher

1. Add a private class that implements the `ActivityLifecycleCallbacks` interface. If you don't have access to this
interface, your app is targeting an Android API level inferior to 14. You will have to update manually each Activity by
following these [instructions](#session-tracking-api9). If you had `Adjust.onResume` and `Adjust.onPause` calls on each
Activity of your app before, you should remove them.

    ![][activity_lifecycle_class]

2. Edit the `onActivityResumed(Activity activity)` method and add a call to `Adjust.onResume()`. Edit the
`onActivityPaused(Activity activity)` method and add a call to `Adjust.onPause()`.

    ![][activity_lifecycle_methods]

3. Add on the `onCreate()` method where the adjust SDK is configured and add call  `registerActivityLifecycleCallbacks`
with an instance of the created `ActivityLifecycleCallbacks` class.

    ```java
    import com.adjust.sdk.Adjust;
    import com.adjust.sdk.AdjustConfig;

    public class GlobalApplication extends Application {
        @Override
        public void onCreate() {
            super.onCreate();

            String appToken = "{YourAppToken}";
            String environment = AdjustConfig.ENVIRONMENT_SANDBOX;
            AdjustConfig config = new AdjustConfig(this, appToken, environment);
            Adjust.onCreate(config);

            registerActivityLifecycleCallbacks(new AdjustLifecycleCallbacks());

            //...
        }

         private static final class AdjustLifecycleCallbacks implements ActivityLifecycleCallbacks {
             @Override
             public void onActivityResumed(Activity activity) {
                 Adjust.onResume();
             }

             @Override
             public void onActivityPaused(Activity activity) {
                 Adjust.onPause();
             }

             //...
         }
      }
    ```

    ![][activity_lifecycle_register]

#### <a id="session-tracking-api9"></a>API level 9 until 13

If your app `minSdkVersion` in gradle is between `9` and `13`, consider updating it to at least `14` to simplify the
integration process in the long term. Consult the official Android [dashboard][android-dashboard] to know the latest market
share of the major versions.

To provide proper session tracking it is required to call certain adjust SDK methods every time any Activity resumes or
pauses. Otherwise the SDK might miss a session start or session end. In order to do so you should **follow these steps for
each Activity of your app**:

1. Open the source file of your Activity.
2. Add the `import` statement at the top of the file.
3. In your Activity's `onResume` method call `Adjust.onResume`. Create the
  method if needed.
4. In your Activity's `onPause` method call `Adjust.onPause`. Create the method
  if needed.

After these steps your activity should look like this:

```java
import com.adjust.sdk.Adjust;
// ...
public class YourActivity extends Activity {
    protected void onResume() {
        super.onResume();
        Adjust.onResume();
    }
    protected void onPause() {
        super.onPause();
        Adjust.onPause();
    }
    // ...
}
```

![][activity]

Repeat these steps for **every** Activity of your app. Don't forget these steps when you create new Activities in the
future. Depending on your coding style you might want to implement this in a common superclass of all your Activities.

### <a id="adjust-logging"></a>Adjust Logging

You can increase or decrease the amount of logs that you see during testing by calling `setLogLevel` on your `AdjustConfig` instance
with one of the following parameters:

```java
config.setLogLevel(LogLevel.VERBOSE);   // enable all logging
config.setLogLevel(LogLevel.DEBUG);     // enable more logging
config.setLogLevel(LogLevel.INFO);      // the default
config.setLogLevel(LogLevel.WARN);      // disable info logging
config.setLogLevel(LogLevel.ERROR);     // disable warnings as well
config.setLogLevel(LogLevel.ASSERT);    // disable errors as well
```

### <a id="build-the-app"></a>Build your app

Build and run your Android app. In your `LogCat` viewer you can set the filter `tag:Adjust` to hide all other logs. After
your app has launched you should see the following Adjust log: `Install tracked`

![][log_message]

## Additional Features

Once you have integrated the adjust SDK into your project, you can take advantage of the following features.

### <a id="event-tracking">Event tracking

You can use adjust to track any event in your app. Suppose you want to track every tap on a button. You would have to
create a new event token in your [dashboard]. Let's say that event token is `abc123`. In your button's `onClick` method you
could then add the following lines to track the click:

```java
AdjustEvent event = new AdjustEvent("abc123");
Adjust.trackEvent(event);
```

#### <a id="revenue-tracking">Revenue tracking

If your users can generate revenue by tapping on advertisements or making In-App Purchases you can track those revenues
with events. Lets say a tap is worth one Euro cent. You could then track the revenue event like this:

```java
AdjustEvent event = new AdjustEvent("abc123");
event.setRevenue(0.01, "EUR");
Adjust.trackEvent(event);
```

This can be combined with callback parameters of course.

When you set a currency token, adjust will automatically convert the incoming revenues into a reporting revenue of your
choice. Read more about [currency conversion here.][currency-conversion]

You can read more about revenue and event tracking in the [event tracking guide.][event-tracking]

The event instance can be used to configure the event further before tracking it:

#### <a id="iap-verification">In-App Purchase verification

If you want to check the validity of In-App Purchases made in your app using Purchase Verification, adjust's server side
receipt verification tool, then check out our Android purchase SDK to read more about it
[here][android-purchase-verification].

#### <a id="callback-parameters">Callback parameters

You can register a callback URL for your events in your [dashboard]. We will send a GET request to that URL whenever the
event is tracked. You can add callback parameters to that event by calling `addCallbackParameter` to the event instance
before tracking it. We will then append these parameters to your callback URL.

For example, suppose you have registered the URL `http://www.adjust.com/callback` then track an event like this:

```java
AdjustEvent event = new AdjustEvent("abc123");

event.addCallbackParameter("key", "value");
event.addCallbackParameter("foo", "bar");

Adjust.trackEvent(event);
```

In that case we would track the event and send a request to:

```
http://www.adjust.com/callback?key=value&foo=bar
```

It should be mentioned that we support a variety of placeholders like `{gps_adid}` that can be used as parameter values.
In the resulting callback this placeholder would be replaced with the Google Play Services ID  of the current device. Also
note that we don't store any of your custom parameters, but only append them to your callbacks. If you haven't registered a callback for an event, these parameters won't even be read.

You can read more about using URL callbacks, including a full list of available values, in our
[callbacks guide][callbacks-guide].

#### <a id="partner-parameters">Partner parameters

You can also add parameters to be transmitted to network partners, which have been activated in your
adjust dashboard.

This works similarly to the callback parameters mentioned above, but can be added by calling the `addPartnerParameter`
method on your `AdjustEvent` instance.

```java
AdjustEvent event = new AdjustEvent("abc123");

event.addPartnerParameter("key", "value");
event.addPartnerParameter("foo", "bar");

Adjust.trackEvent(event);
```

You can read more about special partners and these integrations in our [guide to special partners.][special-partners]

### <a id="session-parameters">Set up session parameters

Some parameters are saved to be sent in every event and session of the adjust SDK.
Once you have added any of these parameters, you don't need to add them every time, since they will be saved locally.
If you add the same parameter twice, there will be no effect.

These session parameters can be called before the adjust SDK is launched to make sure they are sent even on install.
If you need to send them with an install, but can only obtain the needed values after launch, it's possible to [delay](#delay-start) the first launch of the adjust SDK to allow this behaviour.

#### <a id="session-callback-parameters"> Session callback parameters

The same callback parameters that are registered for [events](#callback-parameters) can be also saved to be sent in every event or session of the adjust SDK.

The session callback parameters have a similar interface to the event callback parameters.
Instead of adding the key and it's value to an event, it's added through a call to `Adjust.addSessionCallbackParameter(String key, String value)`:

```java
Adjust.addSessionCallbackParameter("foo", "bar");
```

The session callback parameters will be merged with the callback parameters added to an event.
The callback parameters added to an event have precedence over the session callback parameters.
Meaning that, when adding a callback parameter to an event with the same key to one added from the session, the value that prevails is the callback parameter added to the event.

It's possible to remove a specific session callback parameter by passing the desiring key to the method `Adjust.removeSessionCallbackParameter(String key)`.

```java
Adjust.removeSessionCallbackParameter("foo");
```

If you wish to remove all keys and their corresponding values from the session callback parameters, you can reset it with the method `Adjust.resetSessionCallbackParameters()`.

```java
Adjust.resetSessionCallbackParameters();
```

#### <a id="session-partner-parameters"> Session partner parameters

In the same way that there are [session callback parameters](#session-callback-parameters) sent in every event or session of the adjust SDK, there is also session partner parameters.

These will be transmitted to network partners, for the integrations that have been activated in your adjust [dashboard].

The session partner parameters have a similar interface to the event partner parameters.
Instead of adding the key and it's value to an event, it's added through a call to `Adjust.addSessionPartnerParameter(String key, String value)`:

```java
Adjust.addSessionPartnerParameter("foo", "bar");
```

The session partner parameters will be merged with the partner parameters added to an event.
The partner parameters added to an event have precedence over the session partner parameters.
Meaning that, when adding a partner parameter to an event with the same key to one added from the session, the value that prevails is the partner parameter added to the event.

It's possible to remove a specific session partner parameter by passing the desiring key to the method `Adjust.removeSessionPartnerParameter(String key)`.

```java
Adjust.removeSessionPartnerParameter("foo");
```

If you wish to remove all keys and their corresponding values from the session partner parameters, you can reset it with the method `Adjust.resetSessionPartnerParameters()`.

```java
Adjust.resetSessionPartnerParameters();
```

#### <a id="external-device-id"> External device id

The adjust SDK uses device ids that are available from iOS, but your app might have other sources of identifiers that can help features like ad conversion.

To save your unique identifier in the session parameters that are send in every request and session, call the `Adjust.addExternalDeviceId(String externalDeviceId)` method:

```java
Adjust.addExternalDeviceId("customDeviceId");
```

It's also possible to remove the saved unique identifier by calling the method `Adjust.resetExternalDeviceId()`:

```java
Adjust.resetExternalDeviceId();
```

#### <a id="delay-start"> Delay start

Delaying the start of the adjust SDK allows your app some time to obtain session parameters, such as unique identifiers, to be sent on install.

Set the initial delay time in seconds with the method `setDelayStart` in the `AdjustConfig` instance:

```java
adjustConfig.setDelayStart(5.5);
```

In this case, this will make the adjust SDK not send the initial install session and any event created for 5.5 seconds.
After this time is expired or if you call `Adjust.sendFirstPackages()` in the meanwhile, every session parameter will be added to the delayed install session and events and the adjust SDK will resume as usual.

The maximum delay start time of the adjust SDK is 10 seconds.

### <a id="attribution-callback"></a>Attribution callback

You can register a listener to be notified of tracker attribution changes. Due to the different sources considered for
attribution, this information can not be provided synchronously. The simplest way is to create a single anonymous listener:

Please make sure to consider our [applicable attribution data policies][attribution-data].

With the `AdjustConfig` instance, before starting the SDK, add the anonymous listener:

```java
AdjustConfig config = new AdjustConfig(this, appToken, environment);

config.setOnAttributionChangedListener(new OnAttributionChangedListener() {
    @Override
    public void onAttributionChanged(AdjustAttribution attribution) {
    }
});

Adjust.onCreate(config);
```

Alternatively, you could implement the `OnAttributionChangedListener` interface in your `Application` class and set it as
listener:

```java
AdjustConfig config = new AdjustConfig(this, appToken, environment);
config.setOnAttributionChangedListener(this);
Adjust.onCreate(config);
```

The listener function will be called after the SDK receives the final attribution data. Within the listener function
you have access to the `attribution` parameter. Here is a quick summary of its properties:

- `String trackerToken` the tracker token of the current install.
- `String trackerName` the tracker name of the current install.
- `String network` the network grouping level of the current install.
- `String campaign` the campaign grouping level of the current install.
- `String adgroup` the ad group grouping level of the current install.
- `String creative` the creative grouping level of the current install.
- `String clickLabel` the click label of the current install.

### <a id="session-event-callbacks"></a>Session and event callbacks

You can register a listener to be notified when events or sessions are tracked. There are four listeners: one for tracking
successful events, one for tracking failed events, one for tracking successful sessions and one for tracking failed
sessions. You can add any number of listeners after creating the `AdjustConfig` object:

```java
AdjustConfig config = new AdjustConfig(this, appToken, environment);

// Set event success tracking delegate.
config.setOnEventTrackingSucceededListener(new OnEventTrackingSucceededListener() {
    @Override
    public void onFinishedEventTrackingSucceeded(AdjustEventSuccess eventSuccessResponseData) {
        // ...
    }
});

// Set event failure tracking delegate.
config.setOnEventTrackingFailedListener(new OnEventTrackingFailedListener() {
    @Override
    public void onFinishedEventTrackingFailed(AdjustEventFailure eventFailureResponseData) {
        // ...
    }
});

// Set session success tracking delegate.
config.setOnSessionTrackingSucceededListener(new OnSessionTrackingSucceededListener() {
    @Override
    public void onFinishedSessionTrackingSucceeded(AdjustSessionSuccess sessionSuccessResponseData) {
        // ...
    }
});

// Set session failure tracking delegate.
config.setOnSessionTrackingFailedListener(new OnSessionTrackingFailedListener() {
    @Override
    public void onFinishedSessionTrackingFailed(AdjustSessionFailure sessionFailureResponseData) {
        // ...
    }
});

Adjust.onCreate(config);
```

The listener function will be called after the SDK tries to send a package to the server. Within the listener function you
have access to a response data object specifically for the listener. Here is a quick summary of the success session
response data object fields:

- `String message` the message from the server or the error logged by the SDK.
- `String timestamp` timestamp from the server.
- `String adid` a unique device identifier provided by adjust.
- `JSONObject jsonResponse` the JSON object with the reponse from the server.

Both event response data objects contain:

- `String eventToken` the event token, if the package tracked was an event.

And both event and session failed objects also contain:

- `boolean willRetry` indicates that will be an attempt to resend the package at a later time.

### <a id="disable-tracking"></a>Disable tracking

You can disable the adjust SDK from tracking any activities of the current device by calling `setEnabled` with parameter
`false`. **This setting is remembered between sessions**.

```java
Adjust.setEnabled(false);
```

You can check if the adjust SDK is currently enabled by calling the function `isEnabled`. It is always possible to activatе
the adjust SDK by invoking `setEnabled` with the enabled parameter as `true`.

### <a id="offline-mode"></a>Offline mode

You can put the adjust SDK in offline mode to suspend transmission to our servers, while retaining tracked data to be sent
later. While in offline mode, all information is saved in a file, so be careful not to trigger too many events while in
offline mode.

You can activate offline mode by calling `setOfflineMode` with the parameter `true`.

```java
Adjust.setOfflineMode(true);
```

Conversely, you can deactivate offline mode by calling `setOfflineMode` with `false`. When the adjust SDK is put back in
online mode, all saved information is sent to our servers with the correct time information.

Unlike disabling tracking, this setting is **not remembered** between sessions. This means that the SDK is in online mode
whenever it is started, even if the app was terminated in offline mode.

### <a id="event-buffering"></a>Event buffering

If your app makes heavy use of event tracking, you might want to delay some HTTP requests in order to send them in one
batch every minute. You can enable event buffering with your `AdjustConfig` instance:

```java
AdjustConfig config = new AdjustConfig(this, appToken, environment);

config.setEventBufferingEnabled(true);

Adjust.onCreate(config);
```

### <a id="background-tracking"></a>Background tracking

The default behaviour of the adjust SDK is to pause sending HTTP requests while the app is in the background. You can
change this in your `AdjustConfig` instance:

```java
AdjustConfig config = new AdjustConfig(this, appToken, environment);

config.setSendInBackground(true);

Adjust.onCreate(config);
```

### <a id="device-ids"></a>Device IDs

Certain services (such as Google Analytics) require you to coordinate Device and Client IDs in order to prevent duplicate
reporting.

If you need to obtain the Google Advertising ID, there is a restriction that only allows it to be read in a background
thread. If you call the function `getGoogleAdId` with the context and a `OnDeviceIdsRead` instance, it will work in any
situation:

```java
Adjust.getGoogleAdId(this, new OnDeviceIdsRead() {
    @Override
    public void onGoogleAdIdRead(String googleAdId) {
        // ...
    }
});
```

Inside the method `onGoogleAdIdRead` of the `OnDeviceIdsRead` instance, you will have access to Google Advertising ID as
the variable `googleAdId`.

### <a id="push-token"></a>Push token

To send us the push notification token, add the following call to Adjust once you have obtained your token or when ever
it's value is changed:

```java
Adjust.setPushToken(pushNotificationsToken);
```

### <a id="pre-installed-trackers">Pre-installed trackers

If you want to use the Adjust SDK to recognize users that found your app
pre-installed on their device, follow these steps.

1. Create a new tracker in your [dashboard].
2. Open your app delegate and add set the default tracker of your `AdjustConfig`:

  ```objc
  AdjustConfig config = new AdjustConfig(this, appToken, environment);
  config.setDefaultTracker("{TrackerToken}");
  Adjust.onCreate(config);
  ```

  Replace `{TrackerToken}` with the tracker token you created in step 2.
  Please note that the dashboard displays a tracker URL (including
  `http://app.adjust.com/`). In your source code, you should specify only the
  six-character token and not the entire URL.

3. Build and run your app. You should see a line like the following in LogCat:

    ```
    Default tracker: 'abc123'
    ```

### <a id="deeplinking"></a>Deep linking

If you are using the adjust tracker URL with an option to deep link into your app from the URL, there is the possibility to
get info about the deep link URL and its content. Hitting the URL can happen when the user has your app already installed
(standard deep linking scenario) or if they don't have the app on their device (deferred deep linking scenario). In the
standard deep linking scenario, Android platform natively offers the possibility for you to get the info about the deep
link content. Deferred deep linking scenario is something which Android platform doesn't support out of box and for this
case, the adjust SDK will offer you the mechanism to get the info about the deep link content.

#### <a id="deeplinking-standard">Standard deep linking scenario

If a user has your app installed and you want it to launch after hitting an adjust tracker URL with the `deep_link`
parameter in it, you need enable deep linking in your app. This is being done by choosing a desired **unique scheme name**
and assigning it to the Activity which you want to launch once the app opens after the user clicked on the link. This is
set in the `AndroidManifest.xml`. You need to add the `intent-filter` section to your desired Activity definition in the
manifest file and assign `android:scheme` property value with the desired scheme name:

```xml
<activity
    android:name=".MainActivity"
    android:configChanges="orientation|keyboardHidden"
    android:label="@string/app_name"
    android:screenOrientation="portrait">

    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
    </intent-filter>

    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
        <data android:scheme="adjustExample" />
    </intent-filter>
</activity>
```

With this being set, you need to use the assigned scheme name in the adjust tracker URL's `deep_link` parameter if you want
your app to launch once the tracker URL is clicked. A tracker URL without any information added to the deep link can be
built to look something like this:

```
https://app.adjust.com/abc123?deep_link=adjustExample%3A%2F%2F
```

Please, have in mind that the `deep_link` parameter value in the URL **must be URL encoded**.

After clicking this tracker URL, and with the app set as described above, your app will launch along with the
`MainActivity` intent. Inside the `MainActivity` class, you will automatically be provided with the information about the
`deep_link` parameter content. Once this content is delivered to you, it **will not be encoded**, although it was encoded
in the URL.

Depending on the `android:launchMode` setting of your Activity in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file, information about the
`deep_link` parameter content will be delivered to the appropriate place in the Activity file. For more information about
the possible values of the `android:launchMode` property, check [the official Android documentation][android-launch-modes].

There are two possible places in which information about the deep link content will be delivered to your desired Activity
via `Intent` object - either in the Activity's `onCreate` or `onNewIntent` method. After the app has launched and one of
these methods is triggered, you will be able to get the actual deeplink passed in the `deep_link` parameter in the click
URL. You can then use this information to do some additional logic in your app.

You can extract the deep link content from these two methods like this:

```java
@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

    Intent intent = getIntent();
    Uri data = intent.getData();

    // data.toString() -> This is your deep_link parameter value.
}
```

```java
@Override
protected void onNewIntent(Intent intent) {
    super.onNewIntent(intent);

    Uri data = intent.getData();

    // data.toString() -> This is your deep_link parameter value.
}
```

#### <a id="deeplinking-deferred">Deferred deep linking scenario

Deferred deep linking scenario happens when a user clicks on the adjust tracker URL with the `deep_link` parameter in it,
but does not have the app installed on the device at the moment of click. After that, the user will get redirected to the
Play Store to download and install your app. After opening it for the first time, the content of the `deep_link` parameter
will be delivered to the app.

In order to get info about the `deep_link` parameter content in a deferred deep linking scenario, you should set a listener
method on the `AdjustConfig` object. This will get triggered once the adjust SDK gets the info about the deep link content
from the backend.

```java
AdjustConfig config = new AdjustConfig(this, appToken, environment);

// Evaluate the deeplink to be launched.
config.setOnDeeplinkResponseListener(new OnDeeplinkResponseListener() {
    @Override
    public boolean launchReceivedDeeplink(Uri deeplink) {
        // ...
        if (shouldAdjustSdkLaunchTheDeeplink(deeplink)) {
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
});

Adjust.onCreate(config);
```

Once the adjust SDK receives the info about the deep link content from the backend, it will deliver you the info about its
content in this listener and expect the `boolean` return value from you. This return value represents your decision on
whether the adjust SDK should launch the Activity to which you have assigned the scheme name from the deep link (like in
the standard deep linking scenario) or not.

If you return `true`, we will launch it and the exact same scenario which is described in the
[Standard deep linking scenario chapter](#deeplinking-standard) will happen. If you do not want the SDK to launch the
Activity, you can return `false` from this listener and based on the deep link content decide on your own what to do next
in your app.

#### <a id="deeplinking-reattribution">Reattribution via deep links

Adjust enables you to run re-engagement campaigns with usage of deep links. For more information on how to do that, please
check our [official docs][reattribution-with-deeplinks].

If you are using this feature, in order for your user to be properly reattributed, you need to make one additional call to
the adjust SDK in your app.

Once you have received deep link content information in your app, add a call to `Adjust.appWillOpenUrl` method. By making
this call, the adjust SDK will try to find if there is any new attribution info inside of the deep link and if any, it will
be sent to the adjust backend. If your user should be reattributed due to a click on the adjust tracker URL with deep link
content in it, you will see the [attribution callback](#attribution-callback) in your app being triggered with new
attribution info for this user.

The call to `Adjust.appWillOpenUrl` should be done like this:

```java
@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

    Intent intent = getIntent();
    Uri data = intent.getData();

    Adjust.appWillOpenUrl(data);
}
```

```java
@Override
protected void onNewIntent(Intent intent) {
    super.onNewIntent(intent);

    Uri data = intent.getData();

    Adjust.appWillOpenUrl(data);
}
```

## <a id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting

### <a id="ts-session-failed">I'm seeing the "Session failed (Ignoring too frequent session. ...)" error.

This error typically occurs when testing installs. Uninstalling and reinstalling the app is not enough to trigger a new
install. The servers will determine that the SDK has lost its locally aggregated session data and ignore the erroneous
message, given the information available on the servers about the device.

This behaviour can be cumbersome during tests, but is necessary in order to have the sandbox behaviour match production as
much as possible.

You can reset the session data of the device in our servers. Check the error message in the logs:

```
Session failed (Ignoring too frequent session. Last session: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss, this session: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss, interval: XXs, min interval: 20m) (app_token: {yourAppToken}, adid: {adidValue})
```

With the `{yourAppToken}` and `{adidValue}`/`{gps_adidValue}`/`{androidIDValue}` values filled in below, open one of the following links:


```
http://app.adjust.com/forget_device?app_token={yourAppToken}&adid={adidValue}
```

```
http://app.adjust.com/forget_device?app_token={yourAppToken}&gps_adid={gps_adidValue}
```

```
http://app.adjust.com/forget_device?app_token={yourAppToken}&android_id={androidIDValue}
```

When the device is forgotten, the link just returns `Forgot device`. If the device was already forgotten or the values were
incorrect, the link returns `Device not found`.

### <a id="ts-broadcast-receiver">Is my broadcast receiver capturing the install referrer?

If you followed the instructions in the [guide](#broadcast_receiver), the broadcast receiver should be configured to send
the install referrer to our SDK and to our servers.

You can test this by triggering a test install referrer manually. Replace `com.your.appid` with your app ID and run the
following command with the [adb](http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html) tool that comes with Android Studio:

```
adb shell am broadcast -a com.android.vending.INSTALL_REFERRER -n com.your.appid/com.adjust.sdk.AdjustReferrerReceiver --es "referrer" "adjust_reftag%3Dabc1234%26tracking_id%3D123456789%26utm_source%3Dnetwork%26utm_medium%3Dbanner%26utm_campaign%3Dcampaign"
```

If you are already using a different broadcast receiver for the `INSTALL_REFERRER` intent and followed this
[guide][referrer], replace `com.adjust.sdk.AdjustReferrerReceiver` with your broadcast receiver.

You can also remove the `-n com.your.appid/com.adjust.sdk.AdjustReferrerReceiver` parameter so that all the apps in the
device will receive the `INSTALL_REFERRER` intent.

If you set the log level to `verbose`, you should be able to see the log from reading the referrer:

````
V/Adjust: Reading query string (adjust_reftag=abc1234&tracking_id=123456789&utm_source=network&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=campaign) from reftag
```

And a click package added to the SDK's package handler:

```
V/Adjust: Path:      /sdk_click
    ClientSdk: android4.6.0
    Parameters:
      app_token        abc123abc123
      click_time       yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSS'Z'Z
      created_at       yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSS'Z'Z
      environment      sandbox
      gps_adid         12345678-0abc-de12-3456-7890abcdef12
      needs_attribution_data 1
      referrer         adjust_reftag=abc1234&tracking_id=123456789&utm_source=network&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=campaign
      reftag           abc1234
      source           reftag
      tracking_enabled 1
```

If you perform this test before launching the app, you won't see the package being sent. The package will be sent once the
app is launched.

### <a id="ts-event-at-launch">Can I trigger an event at application launch?

Not how you might intuitively think. The `onCreate` method on the global `Application` class is called not only at
application launch, but also when a system or application event is captured by the app.

Our SDK is prepared for initialization at this time, but not actually started. This will only happen when an activity is
started, i.e., when a user actually launches the app.

That's why triggering an event at this time will not do what you would expect. Such calls will start the adjust SDK and
send the events, even when the app was not launched by the user - at a time that depends on external factors of the app.

Triggering events at application launch will thus result in inaccuracies in the number of installs and sessions tracked.

If you want to trigger an event after the install, use the [attribution changed listener](#attribution_changed_listener).

If you want to trigger an event when the app is launched, use the `onCreate` method of the Activity which is started.
